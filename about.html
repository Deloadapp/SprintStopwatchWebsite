               <h3>About</h3>
               <p>
                   Hey, I'm Mustafa and I'm studying human technology in Cologne 👋🏼.
               </p>
               <p>
                   For the past years, I’ve been using my iPhone’s stopwatch to time athletes’ runs—it’s quick and convenient, but not ideal for tracking multiple sprints at once.<br>
                   It’s easy to miss the stop button, and I got tired of constantly doing the math on lap times. Writing everything down takes extra time, and in the hustle of training, I often start a new note each time—losing track of past results just when I need them🫠
               </p>
               <p>
                   I always thought there had to be a better way, so while procrastinating on my bachelor’s thesis, I started piecing together some code. It quickly became a passion project, and now I’m thrilled to share this app with you!✨
               </p>
               <p>
                  Since this is a hobby project, I’m offering the app for free to make it accessible to as many people as possible. I hope it becomes a valuable tool in your coaching!⏱️
