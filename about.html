               <h3>About</h3>
               <p>
                   Hey, I'm Mustafa and I'm studying human technology in Cologne 👋🏼.
               </p>
               <p>
                   For the past years, I’ve been using the default stopwatch on my iPhone to time athletes’ runs. It’s handy since it’s right in your pocket and ready to go. But it’s not ideal for timing multiple athletes’ sprints or runs. Over the years, I’ve messed up too many timings by missing the start/stop button and got tired of doing the math on all the lap times. If you coach track, you’ve probably encountered these struggles at some point.
               </p>
               <p>
               Writing down the times is also time-intensive, and maybe it’s my lack of organization, but every other month, I’d start a new note for the tracked times, never finding past performances when I needed them.
               </p>
               <p>
                   I always thought there had to be a better way to do this, and while procrastinating on my bachelor thesis, I started throwing together some code.<br>
                   It ended up being an absolute passion project, and I’m quite excited to share this app with you✨
               </p>
               <p>
                   Since this is a hobby project and I want to make it available to as many people as possible, the app is free to use.<br>
                   I really hope you like it and that it assists you well in your coaching ⏱️
